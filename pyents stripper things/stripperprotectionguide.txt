Stripper Config Map Protection Guide

Want to be a total dickhead and prevent servers from playing your map? Say no more. This guide has exactly what you need. 
Credit goes to BotoX for the python scripts.

1. Install Python in order to run the script -- https://www.python.org/

2. Open your map in Hammer and put all point entities that you wish to hide (with certain exceptions, see note below) in a visgroup. Let's call this visgroup "secret". 
Examples of point entities that you may want to hide: logic/math entities, player spawn points, weapons, path_tracks...

IMPORTANT NOTE: Do NOT hide point entities which contain content that needs to be precached. The big examples of this are prop_dynamic and ambient_generic. 
Dynamic models that are strippered into a map without being precached will display as error models, and sounds will not play. 
If you use a different method for precaching models/sounds then it is possible to hide these as well, but that is outside the scope of this guide.

3. Hide the "secret" visgroup (untick the checkbox).

4. Do a full compile of your map that you want to distribute. For the purposes of this guide, we are releasing a map called "ze_crab_escape_v1".

5. Make a duplicate of the map (under a new name), let's call it "ze_crab_escape_v1_ents".
Re-save the vmf with that name too. This version of the map will be compiled WITH all hidden entities.

6. Un-hide the "secret" visgroup.

7. Compile the map with BSP "Only entities", VIS "No" and RAD "No".

Now you can do 2 things:
- Protect even more the map (step 8.)
- Generate the stripper cfg (step 12.)

8 a. If CS:S, install Entspy, it's a tool that allow you to edit entity properties of a BSP file -- https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Entspy
8 b. If CS:GO, use VIDE and its Entity Lump Editor -- https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VIDE

9. Load "ze_crab_escape_v1.bsp" (the one without point entities) in Entspy.

10. Delete every brush entities of the map by selecting them and pressing the Delete button.

11. Once you are done, save the BSP under the same name -- Make sure you don't preserve the checksum.

12. Copy both BSP files to the same folder as entities.py ("ze_crab_escape_v1.bsp" and "ze_crab_escape_v1_ents.bsp")

13. Open a command prompt window and navigate to that folder. If the script is located in C:\PyEnts you would simply type: cd C:\PyEnts

14. The syntax to run the script is the following: python entities.py original.bsp modified.bsp > strippercfg.cfg
This will do a comparison between the two BSP files and output a text file with any entity differences, ready to be loaded by the Stripper plugin.

So run the script by typing: 
python entities.py ze_crab_escape_v1.bsp ze_crab_escape_v1_ents.bsp > ze_crab_escape_v1.cfg
(In this case, the cfg will add all the hidden entities and all the deleted brush entities back)

Congrats, you now have a server-exclusive map. Jerk.
